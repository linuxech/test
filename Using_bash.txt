What is Bash?

- A widely used shell, available on many platforms. 
- Short or Bourne Again Shell, in reference to the earlier Bourne shell. 
- An interactive command-line shell that also allows commands to be combined into script files, which can be run like programs 
	- Combining commands into scripts saves time and reduces errors. 

What is Bash Best for?

- Bash is best for writing small-to medium-size scripts that will run on Linux systems.
- If your workflow can be run as commands in Bash terminal, consider making a script. 
- If your workflow requires other more specialized tools, Bash may not be the best choice for automation. 

##Bash is pre-installed on, or is available to be installed on, most Linux distributions.

//SHELL is variable that is default in Linux. 
echo $SHELL

echo $PATH 
//Another variable that is default in Linux. 


Commands and Built-Ins

- Many of the programs we use in Bash are commands. 
- Separate software that does not depend on Bash.
- Bash includes built-in commands as well.
- Part of Bash itself. 
- Some Bash built-ins have the same name as other commands. 
- See the documentation for a full list of built-ins. 

##Pipes and Redirection

- Pipes send the output of one process to another.
        - For example: ls | wc -l
- Redirection send streams(Standard input, output, and error) to or from files.
        - For example: ls > list.txt

// Redirection
        Stream          Name                            Content
         0              Standard input(stdin)           Keyboard or other input
         1              Standard output(stdout)         Regular output
         2              Standard error(stderr)          Output marked as 'error'

// Redirection
        Symbol          Function
         >              Output redirection(truncate)
        >>              Output redirection(append)
        <               Input redirection
        <<              Here document

Remove Leading Tabs

- Add a -after <<to remove leading tabs:
	
	- cat <<- EOF
		This is some text
		with tabs at the front
	  EOF

	 This is some text
	 with tabs at the front.


##Parentheses 	()
##Braces 	{}
##Brackets	[]

Bash uses these characters differently than other languages.

Expansions and substitutions allow us to specify values that aren't known until a script runs. 

##Bash Expansions and Substitutions

	Representation			Name
	~				Tilde expansion
	{...}				Brace expansion
	${...}				Parameter expansion
	$(...)				Command substitution
	$((...))			Airthmetic expansion

##Brace Expansion
Example code 

echo /tmp/{one,two,three}/file.txt
Output:	    /tmp/one/file.txt  /tmp/two/file.txt /tmp/three/file.txt

echo c{a,o,u}t
Output:	 cat cot cut

echo /tmp/{1..3}/file.txt
Output:	    /tmp/1/file.txt /tmp/2/file.txt /tmp/3/file.txt

echo {00..100}
Output:	   00 01 02 03 04 05 .... 100

## Tilde ~

Represent the user's $HOME environment variable

Example: echo ~ 

#Paramete Expansion

a='Hello World'

echo $a
	Hello World

echo ${a}
	Hello World

echo ${a:1:9}
	ello Worl

echo ${a/World/Everybody}
	Hello Everybody
