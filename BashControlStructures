##Control Structures in Bash

- Allow us to control how script execution happens.
- Run specified code based on conditions. 

#if ..
#then
	...
#fi

If statements execute code based ona conditional expression.

Example:
if /condition
then
	/script/Statment
else
	/script/Statment
fi

#While
While loops runs as long as their condition is true. 

Example:
#while ...
#do
	...
#done


#Until
Until loops run as long as their condtion is false. 

Example:
untill ...
do
	...
done

#For loop
For loops, iterate through a list of items, running code once for each item. 

Example:

#for i in ...
do 
	...
done


#Case Statement

- Checks an input against a set of predefines values.
- Runs code when an input matches a condition. 

#Functions
Functions allows us to repeatedly call a piece of code. 
Older version: Function my_func {...}

Example:
my_func() {
 ...
}


#Function Variable

- $@ represents the list of arguments given to a function. 
- $FUNCNAME represents the name of the function.


#Writing and Reading text Files.
- Write to files with output redirection operators(> and >>)
- echo "abc" > out.txt overwrites the content s of out.txt
- echo "abc" >> out.txt appends to the end of out.txt
